<p> <h2>
	The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is located in the Pacific ocean and it is an island made of trash formed by ocean currents. Humans dump trash in places which get into sewers which eventually flow into the ocean. Many animals such as dolphins, otters, and sea lions get trapped in plastic fishing nets in this garbage patch. It chokes them to death or if the plastic is heavy enough, it drags sea life to the ocean floor to die. What is even worse is that plastic takes a long time to degrade. So fish swimming through this garbage patch can digest small pieces of plasic and the plastic that is getting consumed goes up the food chain and that means it starts to affect us and get into our system. If not for the love of the world around us, we should try to save our species from this horrible fate. 2 million tons of garbage is out there we need to stop that growth or decrease the numbers. </h2>
